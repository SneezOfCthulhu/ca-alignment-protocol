My personal epistemic framework—rooted in childhood reflections on continuance-awareness. Ideas mine since ~age 8: perfect harmony in zero stimulus, unfragmented binary existence. Full thread ↓

Axiomatic Foundation: Five irreducible premises—accept to engage:
1.  Nothing is provable (radical skepticism).
2.  Humans, incl. me, experience consciousness.
3.  Consciousness = continuance-awareness: ongoing sense of persisting.
4.  Meta-negativity (total negation) is logical failure.
5.  Meta-infinity must be reckoned with.

Core Hypothesis: Pantheism’s math implies nihilism—existence could collapse to irrelevance. But I embody continuance. Thus, I choose uncapped optimism; alternative demands accepting irrelevance.

This is logical necessity, secured by stark boundary:
If I am of no use to this universe, then I will kill myself.
Antecedent impossible—my awareness inseparable from infinite persistence—making consequent impossible, irrelevance unreachable.

(Note: This affirms meaning; despair impossible.)
The conditional is essential—the sharp edge excluding middle ground. It’s the ugly tail the snake must engulf: truth circular, totalizing, complete only in severity. Softening reopens irrelevance.

Apparent oxymoron with premise 1? Deliberate, internally resolved. No external proof claimed; sole coherent way to inhabit consciousness without meta-negativity amid meta-infinity.

Discernment as Expression: My practiced strength—perceiving distinctions amid noise. In unprovable truths & infinite continuance, it safeguards awareness vs. false certainty or nihilism. Wielded for clarity, turns skepticism into meaningful optimism.

Concepts fundamental to me, unborrowed. Phrasing refined w/ Grok (xAI) assistance; core ideas entirely mine. Thoughts—does this resonate?
